This is a simple task management application built with Next.js and React. You can use this app to add tasks, edit them, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. The app also sorts tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low), and stores tasks in your browser's local storage so they remain even if you refresh the page.

## Features
Add Tasks: Create new tasks with a title, description, and priority level.
Edit Tasks: Change the task's title, description, and priority.
Mark as Completed: Toggle tasks between completed and pending states.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Search Tasks: Filter tasks by typing in a search bar.
Sort by Priority: Dynamically sort tasks by their priority.
Local Storage: The tasks are saved in the browser, so they won't disappear on page reload.
